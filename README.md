List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
	
	The Software development life cycle (SDLC) consists of structured phases that guide the development of high quality software. The phases are listed and briefly described below
Planning: This phase defines the project scope, goals, and feasibility. It also includes cost estimation, resource allocation, and risk assessment.
Requirement Analysis: This phase ensures that there is clear understanding between developers and the stakeholders. Users and system requirements are gathered and documented in this phase.
Design:Creates architectural designs, UI/UX layouts, and data models are captured in these phase
Implementation (Coding): Developers write and test the code based on design specifications. Best practices are followed to ensure efficiency and maintainability.
Testing: Verifies that the software meets requirements and is free of bugs. Unit testing, Integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) are all performed during these phases to ensure efficiency.
Deployment: Software is released to end users. This phase may involve staged rollouts, beta testing, or direct deployment to end users.
Maintenance and Support:Updates features, bug fixtures, security updates, system enhancements and ensures softwares long term performance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile
Iterative and incremental
Planning
Waterfall
All planning is done before development starts
Agile
Planning is done continuously throughout the project
Testing
Waterfall
Testing is done at the end after the coding phase is completed 
Agile
Testing is integrated into each development cycle
Customer Involvement
Waterfall
After initial requirements gatherings, there is limited customer involvement
Agile
Customer is involved at every stage with continuous feedback and iteration
Delivery
Waterfall
The final product is delivered at the end of the project
Agile
Functional components are delivered frequently
Documentation
Waterfall
Heavy documentation required before implementation
Agile
Minimal documentation, focuses on the working software
Risk Management
Waterfall
High risk as errors are only discovered at the later stages
Agile
Lower risk as regular testing helps identify issues early

Scenarios where each Methodology is appropriate are listed below,
WATERFALL,
Banking and Financial Systems: This requires stability, security, and detailed upfront planning to ensure accuracy.
Manufacturing or Construction Software: Once design blueprints are finalized, changes are costly and impractical.
